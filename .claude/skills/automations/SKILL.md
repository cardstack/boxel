description: Developer guide to the automations system — realm admins' Realm Runner scripts that run on cron, one-time or webhook triggers. Covers how trigger timing is computed (cron in a time zone, daylight saving, `once`, `until` and `count`, per-trigger cursors and run counts, make-up runs after an outage, next run, *done*, runs left) in `runtime-common/automation-schedule.ts`. Use when working on the automations table, the tick, reconcile, the automation card's view, the switch-on estimate, or anything that asks when an automation runs next. Also covers how an automation run reaches a worker — the automation priority tier (`automationInitiatedPriority = 5` in runtime-common's queue.ts), the automation worker lane (`--automationCount` on the worker manager, `WORKER_AUTOMATION_PRIORITY_COUNT` in the start scripts and the dev stack), which lanes claim a run and which never do, and how the tier meets the prerender server's high-priority tab tier. Use when enqueueing the job that runs an automation (from its schedule, reconcile, an automation's webhook trigger, a batch follow-up, Preview or Run now), when a run waits in the queue longer than expected, when sizing or adding the automation lane in a deployment, or when changing the priority tiers, `lib/worker-lanes.ts` or `worker-manager.ts`.

# Automations

An automation is a card in a realm that names a Realm Runner script, its triggers, and what the script may do. A direct writer switches it on and becomes its payer; the server keeps one row per switched-on automation with its payer, state, next run and per-trigger run counts. The card is the definition; the row is the state.

## Trigger timing

`packages/runtime-common/automation-schedule.ts` answers, for an automation's triggers and its per-trigger run state, when it runs next and which triggers are spent. It is pure (no I/O, and it knows the time only through the `now` you pass) and depends only on `Intl`, so the realm server, the worker and the host (the card's view) share it.

### Units

Every instant in and out is **UTC unix seconds**. A trigger's time zone is used only to work out which instants its cron expression names. A card's `once` date, time and time zone become unix seconds through `zonedDateTimeToUnixSeconds('2026-11-09T15:00', 'America/Chicago')`; a cron trigger's `until` goes through the same function in the trigger's zone. Run slots stored as ISO text (the runs table's `slot`) convert with `Date.parse(slot) / 1000`.

### Triggers

| Kind      | Fields                                              | Spent when                                             |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `cron`    | `expression`, `timeZone`, optional `until`, `count` | `count` runs started, or its next time is past `until` |
| `once`    | `at`                                                | `at` is at or before the trigger's cursor              |
| `webhook` | —                                                   | never                                                  |

`until` is inclusive: a time exactly at `until` still fires. With both `until` and `count`, the trigger is spent at whichever comes first.

Every trigger has a **label**, unique within its automation (ADR 028). Run counts, `runState` and run `dedupeKey`s are keyed by it, so editing a trigger's expression, time zone or bounds keeps its count, and a renamed label starts a new one. The counts themselves live on the automation's server row, advanced in the tick's enqueue transaction (ADR 028 §1.5); the library only reads them.

### The cursor

`computeAutomationSchedule({ triggers, since, now, runState, includeRemainingRuns })` schedules each trigger strictly after its own **cursor**, the latest of:

- `since`: when the automation was switched on or resumed;
- `runState[label].lastSlot`: the last slot handled for the trigger, **whether it started a run or joined one already pending**. A skipped slot must still advance it, or every tick claims the same slot again;
- `runState[label].since`: when the trigger's timing (expression, time zone, `at`, `until`) last changed. Set it on an edit, so changing "daily at 09:00" to "daily at 08:00" at 08:30 doesn't fire at once for today's 08:00.

The cursor, not the current time, decides what is due, so a slot that came due but hasn't been enqueued yet stays due however late the next recompute happens. A `once` trigger is spent once its `at` is behind the cursor: it ran (its slot became `lastSlot`), or it was set before the automation was switched on or the trigger was edited. Editing a spent `once` to a later time re-arms it.

`runState[label].runs` counts runs the trigger **started**. A slot that joined a run already pending isn't counted.

### Make-up runs

Pass `now` from the tick and reconcile. When a cron trigger's next slot after its cursor is already at or before `now`, every slot that passed collapses into **one make-up run at the latest of them** (never past `until`), so an outage costs at most one late run per trigger (ADR 028 §1.5). The make-up run counts as one run against `count`. Without `now`, every slot after the cursor comes due in turn, which is right for the card's view and wrong for the tick.

### What it returns

- `nextRun`: the earliest next time across unspent `cron` and `once` triggers, or absent when none is left. At or before `now` means due now.
- `dueTriggers`: the label of every trigger that fires at `nextRun`. Two triggers at the same instant each start a run.
- `done`: every trigger is spent. An automation with a `webhook` trigger is never done, nor is one with a trigger in error; one with no triggers is.
- per trigger: `spent`, `nextRun`, `until`, and `error` when its expression or time zone is invalid (that trigger is skipped, the rest are scheduled).
- with `includeRemainingRuns`, `remainingRuns` for bounded triggers (`once`, or `cron` with `until` or `count`), the next run included: `count − runs`, or the times from the next run to `until`, whichever is smaller. It stops at `REMAINING_RUNS_LIMIT` (10,000) runs or 100 years ahead and then sets `remainingRunsAtLeast`. The card's view shows it as runs left, and the switch-on estimate adds it up; the index recompute and the tick leave it off, since counting scans up to `until`.

### Cron expressions

Five fields (minute, hour, day of month, month, day of week) with `*`, lists, ranges, steps (`*/15`, `1-30/5`, `10/20`), month and day names, `7` for Sunday (and Sunday ending a range counts as 7, so `FRI-SUN` works), and the macros `@hourly`, `@daily`/`@midnight`, `@weekly`, `@monthly`, `@yearly`/`@annually`. No seconds field, no `?`, `L`, `W` or `#`. When both day fields are restricted (neither starts with `*`) a day matches if **either** does, as in Vixie cron: `0 0 13 * FRI` is every Friday and every 13th. A day field starting with `*` is unrestricted even with a step, so `0 0 */31 2 1` means Feb 1 when it is a Monday. An expression that matches no day in a 400-year Gregorian cycle (`0 0 30 2 *`) is an error, because it never fires; any other expression fires within 400 years of any instant, though some only every few decades (`0 0 29 2 */7`, Feb 29 on a Sunday).

`parseCronExpression` throws `CronExpressionError`; `cronExpressionError` returns the message or `undefined`, for validators that report rather than throw. Both results, valid or not, are cached per expression. `isValidTimeZone` checks an IANA name; the runtime's ICU data decides which names exist, so the browser and Node can disagree, and `computeAutomationSchedule` reports such a trigger's `error` rather than throwing.

`nextCronTime`, `nextCronTimes`, `lastCronTime` and `countCronTimes` are the primitives underneath, for the estimate's frequency of unbounded triggers and anything else that needs raw times.

### Daylight saving

- **Wall-clock** expressions (neither the minute nor the hour field starts with `*`) name a time of day, so "daily at 05:30" stays at 05:30 local time all year. A time the clocks skip fires as far past the change as it was into the gap (02:30 in a 02:00→03:00 change fires at 03:30). A time that happens twice fires once, at the first.
- **Elapsed-time** expressions (the minute or the hour field starts with `*`, as Vixie cron splits them) follow elapsed time. Wall times inside a skipped hour don't happen; wall times in a repeated hour fire twice. An hourly trigger gets 23 runs on the spring-forward day and 25 on the fall-back day, and `*/15 1 * * *` fires 8 times on the fall-back day.

A gap can end at midnight (America/Nuuk springs forward from 23:00 straight to 00:00), so a skipped time late on one local day can land on the next. The scans look one day either side for that, and counting never counts one instant twice.

### Cost

Each call scans local days with one `Intl` offset lookup per matching day (about 14 µs each). `nextCronTime` stops at the first day with a time. Counting runs left is the expensive part, which is why it is opt-in and bounded: the worst case, a daily trigger whose `until` is more than 27 years out, stops at 10,000 runs after about 200 ms. Parsing an expression that matches rarely scans up to a 400-year cycle of days once, and the result is cached.

## The queue tier and worker lane

### The automation tier

A queued job's priority is a claim floor, not an ordering. A worker claims only jobs at or above its floor, oldest first among those. The tiers, from the comment block in `packages/runtime-common/queue.ts`:

| priority | constant                               | job                                |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| 10       | `userInitiatedPriority`                | user indexing (+ any user job)     |
| 9        | `userInitiatedPrerenderHtmlPriority`   | user prerender-html                |
| 5        | `automationInitiatedPriority`          | the job that runs an automation    |
| 1        | `systemInitiatedPriority`              | system indexing (+ any system job) |
| 0        | `systemInitiatedPrerenderHtmlPriority` | system prerender-html              |

The run-command job that runs an automation goes at `automationInitiatedPriority`, whatever started the run: its schedule, reconcile, one of its webhook triggers, a batch follow-up, Preview, or Run now. Import the constant from `@cardstack/runtime-common`. Don't write the number. A webhook command that is not an automation (`handlers/handle-webhook-receiver.ts`) is ordinary user work and enqueues at `userInitiatedPriority`.

The tier is for that job alone. Never enqueue index or prerender-html work at it. The indexing a run's writes cause takes whatever tier the realm's write path gives it. Two helpers place anything below 9 in the system tier: `isUserInitiatedTier` in `pg-queue.ts` decides how a writer lane waits on its family's exclusive jobs, and `prerenderHtmlPriority` in `jobs/prerender-html.ts` picks an index pass's HTML render tier. So an index pass at 5 would wait behind a system-tier full reindex in its family, and its HTML renders would drop to 0. The run-command job itself is outside both: it runs in its realm's `command:` concurrency group, which belongs to no lane family.

The tier sits above the system tiers so a run due at a set time is not queued behind a system backlog such as a full reindex. It sits below the user tiers so a run never takes a high-priority worker held for someone who is waiting.

### The lanes

The worker manager starts one worker per count in each lane. The list lives in `packages/realm-server/lib/worker-lanes.ts` (`workerSpecs`):

| lane          | option                | start-script variable              | floor | claims                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----- | ------------------------------------------- |
| user-index    | `--userIndexCount`    | (none)                             | 10    | user-tier indexing job types only           |
| high-priority | `--highPriorityCount` | `WORKER_HIGH_PRIORITY_COUNT`       | 9     | all user-initiated work                     |
| automation    | `--automationCount`   | `WORKER_AUTOMATION_PRIORITY_COUNT` | 5     | automation runs and all user-initiated work |
| all-priority  | `--allPriorityCount`  | `WORKER_ALL_PRIORITY_COUNT`        | 0     | everything                                  |

The automation lane defaults to 0 workers. With it at 0 an automation run is claimed only by the all-priority lane, in FIFO order with the system work there, so a deployment without the lane still runs every automation, just not ahead of a system backlog. When no run is due the automation lane's workers take user-initiated jobs. They never take system-tier work.

The tests that pin these claims are the `queue - automation lane`, `queue - automation runs without an automation lane` and `queue - automation lane and system-tier work` modules in `packages/realm-server/tests/queue-test.ts`, and `tests/worker-lanes-test.ts` for the lane list itself.

### Sizing the lane

- **Worker task memory.** The worker manager divides its task's memory across every worker it starts, automation workers included (`workerHeapLimitMb` in `lib/worker-heap-limit.ts`). Each automation worker added shrinks every other worker's heap in that task.
- **Prerender tabs.** An automation run is a run-command job, which runs its command in a prerender tab at its job priority. Each worker that can claim a run is one more tab the prerender servers may have to hold at once. See the `prerender-sizing` skill before raising the count.

### The prerender high-priority tier

The prerender server's page pool reserves headroom past `PRERENDER_PAGE_POOL_MAX`, up to `PRERENDER_PAGE_POOL_HIGH_PRIORITY_MAX`, for renders whose priority is at least `PRERENDER_HIGH_PRIORITY_THRESHOLD`. An automation run does not count as high priority there: the headroom is for a user who is waiting. That holds only while the threshold is above 5, so set it to `userInitiatedPrerenderHtmlPriority` (9). A threshold of 5 or less admits automation runs to the reserved headroom.
