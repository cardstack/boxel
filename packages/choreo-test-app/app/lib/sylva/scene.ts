/**
 * Sylva's living world, vendored.
 *
 * The scene is a near-verbatim port of `inner-green-3d.html` from
 * ~/Projects/threeui (the "Living Green — Sylva" shader page): two roots swept
 * along centrelines traced off the original artwork's alpha channel, ~190k
 * instanced moss blades planted on whatever faces the light, a butterfly, and
 * a cursor spray. None of that is ours and none of it is edited — the diff
 * against the original is this header, the wrapper below, and the boot block,
 * which the host now drives instead of the page.
 *
 * IT RUNS ON ITS OWN THREE. The original is written against r149 and this repo
 * is on r185, which spans the colour-management and lighting-default breaks;
 * a scene this shader-heavy would need every one of them chased down, and that
 * work would teach us nothing about the thing the route exists to test. So
 * `three-149` is an aliased dependency and this file is the only importer.
 * Nothing here touches the engine the rest of the app animates on — the bridge
 * between them is a matrix, which has no version.
 *
 * WHY THIS SCENE. It was picked for its geometry, not its looks: a moss root
 * with an arch and a hollow under it is a shape that can stand in FRONT of a
 * DOM card, which is exactly the case `docs/dom-in-3d.md` lists as unproven.
 * A flat backdrop could not test occlusion at all.
 *
 * The one lucky alignment: its camera is already authored in pixels —
 * `fov = 2·atan((H/2)/DIST)` — so one world unit is one CSS pixel, which is
 * the mapping `objectCss` requires. No unit remapping, and the trap named in
 * the compositing note ("a scene authored at 2.6 units for a whole phone")
 * does not apply.

     Lifted from sakura-branch-hero: the wings are modelled to their real
     outline rather than alpha-cut from a texture, the scale pattern is baked
     once into (span, chord) rather than evaluated per fragment, and the
     flight is a cycle — cruise, approach, settle on a nominated perch with
     the wings held open, take off, round again.

     Two things are different here. The blue is a morpho's structural
     colour; this one is a swallowtail's yellow-green, so the face and edge
     hues are re-solved while the angle-dependence that makes it read as
     diffraction rather than paint is kept. And it lives inside nearGroup, so
     it is modelled in the root's own local units and rides the branch's
     placement, scale and parallax for free — including the perch, which is
     a point on the moss rather than on a blossom. */
