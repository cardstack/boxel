Microblogs \"allow users to exchange small elements of content such as short sentences, individual images, or video links\",[1] which may be the major reason for their popularity.[4] Some popular social networks such as Twitter, Threads, Mastodon, Tumblr, Koo, and Instagram can be viewed as collections of microblogs.",
