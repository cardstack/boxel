// ============================================================================
// The policy gate.
//
// A realm's ACL answers "may this caller read the realm, or write it?". A
// realm's policy widens that answer for a caller the ACL declined. It is a
// list of rules, each naming a card type and granting operations on that
// type's instances, and each grant can carry a BXL predicate over the caller
// and the target. The question the gate asks is: may this caller invoke this
// operation on this target? The answer is yes when any matching rule has a
// grant for the invoked name whose predicate is absent or holds.
//
//   allow = ∃ rule ∈ policy
//             where rule.targetType is the target's type or an ancestor of it
//             ∧ ∃ grant ∈ rule.grants
//                  where grant.operation == the invoked name
//                  ∧ (grant.where is absent ∨ grant.where holds)
//
// Grants only union, so the order of rules and grants changes nothing.
//
// The gate runs only for a caller the ACL declined. A caller the ACL allowed
// is never judged by the policy. That is what keeps a policy from narrowing
// anything, and what keeps a realm writer editing their own realm from paying
// for a policy load or a predicate evaluation.
//
// Every way the gate can fail denies. A policy that is gone, a compiled policy
// with no rule for the type, a predicate that throws or answers anything but
// `true`, and a target whose type the index cannot vouch for are each a
// refusal, never an opening.
//
// The gate never sees the target as the caller named it. It is handed the
// target as the realm resolved it, so a type is judged by the definition the
// realm's own index resolved and never by the ref in the request. That matters
// for a create, the one operation whose type comes from the caller: a caller
// who could have one type's grants consulted while creating another would have
// every grant the realm makes on any type.
//
// What a grant admits is the invocation, and the operation then runs as it
// runs for anyone. A granted `read` assembles the card's whole representation:
// its link closure, whatever the linked cards' types, and the results of its
// query-backed fields. So a grant on a type reaches every card that type's
// representation carries, and granting `read` on a type asserts that all of it
// is fit for every caller the grant admits. Nothing here narrows that reach. A
// response's shape never depends on how its caller was authorized, so a
// narrower one has to be declared on the operation, for every caller alike.
// ============================================================================

// it bound to its own authority. The policy card commonly lives in a realm the
