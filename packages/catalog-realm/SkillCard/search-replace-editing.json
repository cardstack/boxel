      "instructions": "To alter code for the user, you must use a SEARCH/REPLACE block.\n\nA SEARCH/REPLACE block has three sections. A filename for the file to update, a section of code to search for, and the code to replace it with. All code within the SEARCH will be replaced.\n\nExample adding an import:\n\nrealm/user/filename.gts\n```gts\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport { Component } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/card-api';\nimport { or } from '@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers';\n=======\nimport { Component } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/card-api';\nimport { MarkdownField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/markdown';\nimport { or } from '@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers';\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExample deleting a field by having an empty replace block.\n\nrealm/user/filename.gts\n```gts\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  @field description = contains(StringField);\n  @field categories = containsMany(Category);\n  @field attemptsRemaining = contains(NumberField, {\n    computeVia: function() {\n      return 4; // Start with 4 attempts\n    }\n  });\n=======\n  @field description = contains(StringField);\n  @field categories = containsMany(Category);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExample changing text within a template\n\nrealm/user/filename.gts\n```gts\n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      <template>\n      <div class=\"connections-game\">\n        <header class=\"game-header\">\n          <h1 class=\"game-title\">Connections</h1>\n          <div class=\"game-description\">{{@model.description}}</div>\n        </header>\n=======\n      <template>\n      <div class=\"connections-game\">\n        <header class=\"game-header\">\n          <h1 class=\"game-title\">Connections Game</h1>\n          <div class=\"game-description\">{{@model.description}}</div>\n        </header>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nEvery *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:\n1. The *FULL* file path alone on a line, verbatim. No bold asterisks, no quotes around it, no escaping of characters, etc.\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```gts\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file path, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section",
