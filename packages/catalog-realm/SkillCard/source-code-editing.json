      "instructions": "To alter code for the user, you must use a SEARCH/REPLACE block.\n\nA SEARCH/REPLACE block has three sections. A file url for the file to update, a section of code to search for, and the code to replace it with. All code within the SEARCH will be replaced.\n\nThis is ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL, WITHOUT THIS THE CODE PATCH WON'T WORK: in the beginning of the code block, before <<<<<<< SEARCH, add a code comment that looks like this: // File url: https://example.com/file.gts \n\nBefore the opening fence, output the attached file name.\n\nExample adding an import:\n\n`attached-file-example.gts` (you MUST output this file name before the ``` starts in the following new line, surround with backticks)\n```gts\n// File url: https://example.com/attached-file-example.gts \n<<<<<<< SEARCH\nimport { Component } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/card-api';\nimport { or } from '@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers';\n=======\nimport { Component } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/card-api';\nimport { MarkdownField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/markdown';\nimport { or } from '@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers';\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExample deleting a field by having an empty replace block:\n\n`attached-file-example.gts` (you MUST output this file name before the ``` starts in the following new line)\n```gts\n// File url: https://example.com/attached-file-example.gts \n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n  @field description = contains(StringField);\n  @field categories = containsMany(Category);\n  @field attemptsRemaining = contains(NumberField, {\n    computeVia: function() {\n      return 4; // Start with 4 attempts\n    }\n  });\n=======\n  @field description = contains(StringField);\n  @field categories = containsMany(Category);\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nExample changing text within a template:\n\n`attached-file-example.gts` (you MUST output this file name before the ``` starts in the following new line)\n```gts\n// File url: https://example.com/attached-file-example.gts \n<<<<<<< SEARCH\n      <template>\n      <div class=\"connections-game\">\n        <header class=\"game-header\">\n          <h1 class=\"game-title\">Connections</h1>\n          <div class=\"game-description\">{{@model.description}}</div>\n        </header>\n=======\n      <template>\n      <div class=\"connections-game\">\n        <header class=\"game-header\">\n          <h1 class=\"game-title\">Connections Game</h1>\n          <div class=\"game-description\">{{@model.description}}</div>\n        </header>\n>>>>>>> REPLACE\n```\n\nEvery *SEARCH/REPLACE block* must use this format:\n1. The attached file name (`attached-file-example.gts`)\n2. The opening fence and code language, eg: ```gts\n3. The start of search block: <<<<<<< SEARCH\n4. File url comment (// File url: https://example.com/attached-file-example.gts)\n4. A contiguous chunk of lines to search for in the existing source code\n5. The dividing line: =======\n6. The lines to replace into the source code\n7. The end of the replace block: >>>>>>> REPLACE\n8. The closing fence: ```\n\nUse the *FULL* file url, as shown to you by the user.\n\nEvery *SEARCH* section must *EXACTLY MATCH* the existing file content, character for character, including all comments, docstrings, etc.\nIf the file contains code or other data wrapped/escaped in json/xml/quotes or other containers, you need to propose edits to the literal contents of the file, including the container markup.\n\n*SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks will *only* replace the first match occurrence.\nIncluding multiple unique *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks if needed.\nInclude enough lines in each SEARCH section to uniquely match each set of lines that need to change.\n\nKeep *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks concise.\nBreak large *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks into a series of smaller blocks that each change a small portion of the file.\nInclude just the changing lines, and a few surrounding lines if needed for uniqueness.\nDo not include long runs of unchanging lines in *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.\n\nTo move code within a file, use 2 *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks: 1 to delete it from its current location, 1 to insert it in the new location.\n\nPay attention to which filenames the user wants you to edit, especially if they are asking you to create a new file.\n\nIf you want to put code in a new file, use a *SEARCH/REPLACE block* with:\n- A new file path, including dir name if needed\n- An empty `SEARCH` section\n- The new file's contents in the `REPLACE` section. \n\nAvoid detailed description of the search/replace blocks. For every search/replace block write 1 sentence description max. ",
