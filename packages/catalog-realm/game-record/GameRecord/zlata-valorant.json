Need to dedicate more time to learning all the agents and map callouts.\n\n**First impressions:**\n- Gunplay feels crisp\n- Agent abilities are interesting\n- Need to work on crosshair placement\n- Ranked anxiety is real\n\n**Goals:**\n- Learn 3 agents well\n- Understand all map layouts\n- Get to Gold rank\n- Stop panic-buying every round",
