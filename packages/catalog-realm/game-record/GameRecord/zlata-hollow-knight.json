The atmosphere, music, art style, and challenging combat all come together perfectly.\n\n**What made it special:**\n- Every boss fight felt rewarding\n- The lore is deep and mysterious\n- Platforming mechanics are tight and responsive\n- Grimm Troupe DLC was incredible\n\n**Achievements:**\n- Beat Radiance on first try (okay, maybe 50th try)\n- 112% completion\n- All charms collected\n- Defeated Nightmare King Grimm\n\nDefinitely going back for the Godmaster DLC soon!",
