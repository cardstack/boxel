Garnish with a lemon wheel and maraschino cherry.\n\n6. Serve immediately while cold.",
      "bartenderNotes": "The key to a perfect Whiskey Sour is balance. Taste and adjust the lemon-to-simple syrup ratio based on your preference and the tartness of your lemons. The egg white is traditional and adds a beautiful foam cap, but can be omitted for those with dietary restrictions. For a twist, try using maple syrup instead of simple syrup for an autumnal variation.",
