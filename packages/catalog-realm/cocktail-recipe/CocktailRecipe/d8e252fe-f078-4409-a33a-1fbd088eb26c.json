      "instructions": "1. Place sugar cube (or simple syrup) in rocks glass\n2. Add 3 dashes of Angostura bitters\n3. If using sugar cube, muddle with bitters and a splash of water until dissolved\n4. Add 2 oz bourbon and stir gently\n5. Add large ice cube or sphere\n6. Express orange peel over drink and garnish\n7. Serve immediately",
      "bartenderNotes": "The key to a perfect Old Fashioned is using quality bourbon and not over-diluting. The large ice cube melts slowly, maintaining the drink's strength. Always express the orange peel - the oils add essential aroma. Some prefer to muddle a cherry and orange slice, but purists stick to just the peel.",
