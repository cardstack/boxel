Strain into an old fashioned glass over one large ice cube.\n\n4. Express the oils from the orange peel over the drink by gently twisting it.\n\n5. Drop the orange peel into the glass as garnish.\n\n6. Serve immediately.",
      "bartenderNotes": "The Negroni's beauty lies in its perfect 1:1:1 ratio. Some prefer to adjust this slightly - try 1.25:0.75:1 for a more gin-forward version. The quality of vermouth matters significantly; store opened bottles in the refrigerator and use within a month. For a lighter variation, try a Negroni Sbagliato by substituting Prosecco for gin.",
      "origin": "Florence, Italy, 1919. Created at Caff√® Casoni when Count Camillo Negroni asked bartender Fosco Scarselli to strengthen his Americano by replacing soda water with gin.",
