You correctly added 15 + 27 = 42.\n\n2. **Division (48 ÷ 6 = ?)**: **NO ANSWER PROVIDED** (0/5 points)\n   - The correct answer is **8**\n   - Remember: 48 ÷ 6 means \"how many groups of 6 can we make from 48?\"\n   - You can check this by multiplying: 6 × 8 = 48\n\n3. **Multiplication (13 × 4 = ?)**: Your answer \"52\" is **CORRECT!** ✓ (5/5 points)\n   - Great job! 13 × 4 = 52. You can think of this as (10 × 4) + (3 × 4) = 40 + 12 = 52.\n\n4. **Subtraction (45 - 19 = ?)**: **NO ANSWER PROVIDED** (0/5 points)\n   - The correct answer is **26**\n   - To subtract: 45 - 19. Start with 45 and take away 19.\n   - One way to think about it: 45 - 20 = 25, then add back 1 to get 26.\n\n**Total Score: 10 out of 20 points (50%)**\n\n**Areas for Improvement:**\n- Complete ALL questions - leaving questions blank means missing out on possible points\n- Practice division problems and remember the relationship between division and multiplication\n- Work on subtraction strategies and double-check your arithmetic\n- Show your work when possible to help identify where errors might occur\n\n**What You Did Well:**\n- Excellent work on the addition and multiplication problems you completed!\n- Your answers for questions 1 and 3 show you understand these operations well\n- When you attempt problems, you're getting them right!\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Make sure to attempt every question, even if you're not completely sure\n- Practice basic division and subtraction facts\n- Remember to check your work before submitting\n\nDon't get discouraged - you clearly understand addition and multiplication well. With practice on the other operations and completing all questions, your grades will improve significantly!"
