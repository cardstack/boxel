        "description": "Claude Haiku 4.5 is Anthropic’s fastest and most efficient model, delivering near-frontier intelligence at a fraction of the cost and latency of larger Claude models. Matching Claude Sonnet 4’s performance across reasoning, coding, and computer-use tasks, Haiku 4.5 brings frontier-level capability to real-time and high-volume applications.\n\nIt introduces extended thinking to the Haiku line; enabling controllable reasoning depth, summarized or interleaved thought output, and tool-assisted workflows with full support for coding, bash, web search, and computer-use tools. Scoring >73% on SWE-bench Verified, Haiku 4.5 ranks among the world’s best coding models while maintaining exceptional responsiveness for sub-agents, parallelized execution, and scaled deployment.",
