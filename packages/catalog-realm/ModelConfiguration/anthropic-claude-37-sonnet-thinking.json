                "description": "Claude 3.7 Sonnet is an advanced large language model with improved reasoning, coding, and problem-solving capabilities. It introduces a hybrid reasoning approach, allowing users to choose between rapid responses and extended, step-by-step processing for complex tasks. The model demonstrates notable improvements in coding, particularly in front-end development and full-stack updates, and excels in agentic workflows, where it can autonomously navigate multi-step processes. \n\nClaude 3.7 Sonnet maintains performance parity with its predecessor in standard mode while offering an extended reasoning mode for enhanced accuracy in math, coding, and instruction-following tasks.\n\nRead more at the [blog post here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-3-7-sonnet)",
