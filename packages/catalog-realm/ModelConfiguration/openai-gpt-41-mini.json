                "description": "GPT-4.1 Mini is a mid-sized model delivering performance competitive with GPT-4o at substantially lower latency and cost. It retains a 1 million token context window and scores 45.1% on hard instruction evals, 35.8% on MultiChallenge, and 84.1% on IFEval. Mini also shows strong coding ability (e.g., 31.6% on Aiderâ€™s polyglot diff benchmark) and vision understanding, making it suitable for interactive applications with tight performance constraints.",
