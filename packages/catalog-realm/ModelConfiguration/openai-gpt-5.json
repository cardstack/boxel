It is optimized for complex tasks that require step-by-step reasoning, instruction following, and accuracy in high-stakes use cases. It supports test-time routing features and advanced prompt understanding, including user-specified intent like \"think hard about this.\" Improvements include reductions in hallucination, sycophancy, and better performance in coding, writing, and health-related tasks.",
