      "description": "TNG-R1T-Chimera is an experimental LLM with a faible for creative storytelling and character interaction. It is a derivate of the original TNG/DeepSeek-R1T-Chimera released in April 2025 and is available exclusively via Chutes and OpenRouter.\n\nCharacteristics and improvements include:\n\nWe think that it has a creative and pleasant personality.\nIt has a preliminary EQ-Bench3 value of about 1305.\nIt is quite a bit more intelligent than the original, albeit a slightly slower.\nIt is much more think-token consistent, i.e. reasoning and answer blocks are properly delineated.\nTool calling is much improved.\n\nTNG Tech, the model authors, ask that users follow the careful guidelines that Microsoft has created for their \"MAI-DS-R1\" DeepSeek-based model. These guidelines are available on Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/microsoft/MAI-DS-R1).",
