      "description": "MiniMax-M2 is a compact, high-efficiency large language model optimized for end-to-end coding and agentic workflows. With 10 billion activated parameters (230 billion total), it delivers near-frontier intelligence across general reasoning, tool use, and multi-step task execution while maintaining low latency and deployment efficiency.\n\nThe model excels in code generation, multi-file editing, compile-run-fix loops, and test-validated repair, showing strong results on SWE-Bench Verified, Multi-SWE-Bench, and Terminal-Bench. It also performs competitively in agentic evaluations such as BrowseComp and GAIA, effectively handling long-horizon planning, retrieval, and recovery from execution errors.\n\nBenchmarked by [Artificial Analysis](https://artificialanalysis.ai/models/minimax-m2), MiniMax-M2 ranks among the top open-source models for composite intelligence, spanning mathematics, science, and instruction-following. Its small activation footprint enables fast inference, high concurrency, and improved unit economics, making it well-suited for large-scale agents, developer assistants, and reasoning-driven applications that require responsiveness and cost efficiency.\n\nTo avoid degrading this model's performance, MiniMax highly recommends preserving reasoning between turns.
