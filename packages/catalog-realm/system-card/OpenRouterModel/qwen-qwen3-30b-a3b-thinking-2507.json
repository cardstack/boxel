      "description": "Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 is a 30B parameter Mixture-of-Experts reasoning model optimized for complex tasks requiring extended multi-step thinking. The model is designed specifically for “thinking mode,” where internal reasoning traces are separated from final answers.\n\nCompared to earlier Qwen3-30B releases, this version improves performance across logical reasoning, mathematics, science, coding, and multilingual benchmarks. It also demonstrates stronger instruction following, tool use, and alignment with human preferences. With higher reasoning efficiency and extended output budgets, it is best suited for advanced research, competitive problem solving, and agentic applications requiring structured long-context reasoning.",
