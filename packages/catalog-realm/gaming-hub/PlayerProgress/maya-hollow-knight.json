      "notes": "## Absolute Masterpiece\n\nHollow Knight is hands down one of the best Metroidvania games ever created. The art style is breathtaking and the gameplay is incredibly tight.\n\n**What I Love:**\n- Gorgeous hand-drawn art\n- Perfect controls and movement\n- Incredible boss fights\n- Amazing soundtrack by Christopher Larkin\n- Environmental storytelling at its finest\n\n**Current Progress:**\n- Just defeated the Mantis Lords\n- Exploring Deepnest (so creepy!)\n- Working on Steel Soul mode\n\nThis game keeps surprising me with its depth and attention to detail.",
