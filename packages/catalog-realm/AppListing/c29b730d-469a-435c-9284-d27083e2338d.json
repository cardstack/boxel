      "summary": "Create a Music Hub application in the Boxel framework to showcase interactive music-related UI cards. The app serves as a central space for music discovery, creation, and artist engagement. It focuses on delivering visually appealing, modular card components without dependency on live data integrations.\n\n---\n\n## Core Features\n\n### Music Discovery\n- **Album Card** – Display album artwork, title, and artist.\n- **Playlist Card** – Show curated playlists with cover image and description.\n- **Song Card** – Highlight a single track with artist name and duration.\n- **Mood → Playlist Card** – Select a mood (e.g., Happy, Chill, Energetic) to reveal a matching playlist.\n\n### Music Creation Tools\n- **Piano Card** – Interactive piano interface mockup.\n- **Chord Progression Card** – Show common chord sequences with optional playback.\n- **Beat Maker Card** – Grid-style beat pattern editor mockup.\n- **Recording Card** – Simulated audio recording interface.\n\n### Artist & Events\n- **Musician Landing Page Card** – Artist profile with photo, music samples, and short bio.\n- **Shows Card** – Upcoming event list with date, venue, and image.\n- **Ticket Card** – Event ticket display with “Buy” or “Reserve” button.\n\n---\n\n## User Interface Design\n- **Modular Card Layout** – All features presented as standalone cards for flexibility.\n- **Group Sections** – Three main categories: Music Discovery, Creation Tools, Artist & Events.\n- **Static Mock Data** – All content is sample-based to avoid API dependencies.\n- **Interactive States** – Hover, click, and basic animations to enhance visual appeal.\n\n---\n\n## Technical Notes\n- Built in **Boxel** framework for easy UI arrangement.\n- No backend integration required — static JSON or hardcoded mock data.\n- Responsive design for desktop and mobile views.\n- Cards follow consistent sizing, spacing, and style guidelines.\n",
