What's happening?\"\n\nStatic roars back at you, then suddenly clears. A woman's voice—**Dr. Sarah Martinez**, the station's chief xenobiologist—breaks through, urgent and breathless:\n\n*\"Thank God! Listen carefully—we're in the emergency pod bay, but we can't launch. The entity... it's not trying to come through. It's already here. It's been **learning from us**, studying. The vortex is just... it's like a window it opened to show us what it wants us to see.\"*\n\nThe containment unit's glow intensifies. The reading drops to 38%.\n\n*\"Chen discovered it could manipulate quantum fields. We tried to contain it, but—\"* Her voice breaks. *\"It **wants** something. It's been accessing our databases, our memories. You need to—\"*\n\nA new presence fills your mind—not words, but **pure concept**. The entity is trying to communicate directly with you. You sense:\n- **Curiosity** mixed with **loneliness**\n- Images of a dying dimension seeking refuge\n- A plea for **understanding**, not destruction\n- But also **hunger**—an endless void that needs to feed on energy to survive\n\nMartinez's voice returns: *\"Whatever you do, DON'T let it fully materialize! The override might work, but... we don't know if it'll trap it or just make it angry. Your call!\"*\n\nContainment: 35%\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n1. **Hit the override NOW**—trap it before it's too late\n2. **Try to communicate** with the entity mentally—seek understanding\n3. **Ask Martinez for the pod bay location**—evacuate and let station protocols handle it\n4. **Rush to your workstation**—find Chen's research for a solution\n\n*Or describe your own action...*",
