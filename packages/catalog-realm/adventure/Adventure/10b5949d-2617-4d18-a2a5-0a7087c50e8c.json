The reinforced transparent panel reveals something that shouldn't exist—a **swirling vortex of iridescent energy**, pulsing with colors that hurt to look at directly. It's beautiful and terrifying in equal measure.\n\nThe control panel beside the unit flickers erratically, displaying impossible readings: *Dimensional Breach Detected • Containment Integrity: 47% • Unknown Entity Present*.\n\nAs you lean closer, the vortex seems to **respond to your presence**. Tendrils of light reach toward the containment wall, and for a brief moment, you see something in the swirling chaos—shapes that might be buildings, landscapes from somewhere else, somewhere *wrong*.\n\nSuddenly, your helmet comm crackles to life with static, then a distorted voice: *\"...don't touch it... Chen was right... it's trying to...\"* The message cuts out.\n\nThe containment unit's integrity drops to 42%. Warning klaxons begin blaring throughout the lab. You notice:\n- An **emergency containment override** button (red) that could strengthen the field—or overload it\n- A **data extraction port** that could download whatever the unit has recorded\n- Your workstation's analysis is still running—it might have answers\n- The exit is still clear... for now\n\n**What do you do?**\n\n1. **Hit the emergency override** to try to stabilize the containment\n2. **Extract the containment unit's data** to understand what you're dealing with\n3. **Back away and check your workstation** for the analysis results\n4. **Attempt communication** through the static—someone's trying to warn you\n\n*Or describe your own action...*",
