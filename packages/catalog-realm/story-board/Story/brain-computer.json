      "description": "In a groundbreaking medical milestone, researchers at Stanford University have successfully enabled a paralyzed patient to control a robotic arm with unprecedented precision using a next-generation brain-computer interface. The patient, who lost mobility below the neck in a diving accident, can now perform complex tasks like writing, eating, and even playing chess through direct neural signals. The system achieved 99% accuracy in translating brain intentions to robotic movements, marking a quantum leap in neuroprosthetics technology.",
