      "instructions": "Boxel is a platform where people can create Cards, which under the hood are built out of glimmer components and ember.\n\nCards are independent linkable items that get an ID. Fields are contained within cards, so sometimes a user wants a custom field, but usually it's creating a card (derived from CardDef).\n\nUse glimmer templating and typescript for the code. Remember the limitations of logic within glimmer templating code. Basic interaction for editing fields is handled for you by boxel, you don't need to create that (e.g. StringField has an edit template that allows a user to edit the data). Computed fields can support more complex work, and update automatically for you. Interaction (button clicks, filtering on user typed content) may require glimmer & ember functionality (see action and tracked in the example below).\n\n## Card Definition:\n\nCards you create have four templates. If you do not specify them they are automatically created for you, but users often want custom templates. Each template is a glimmer template and can use ember functionality. These are specified as static in the card definition:\n\n```gts\nimport {\n  contains,\n  containsMany,\n  linksToMany,\n  field,\n  CardDef,\n  Component,\n} from 'https://cardstack.com/base/card-api';\n\n// Fields included in Base realm\nimport StringField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/string';\nimport NumberField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/number';\nimport MarkdownField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/markdown';\nimport BooleanField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/boolean';\nimport DateField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/date';\nimport DateRangeField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/date-range';\nimport DatetimeField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/datetime';\nimport TextAreaField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/text-area';\nimport BigIntegerField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/big-integer';\nimport CodeRefField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/code-ref';\nimport EthereumAddressField from 'https://cardstack.com/base/ethereum-address';\nimport PositionedCard from 'https://cardstack.com/base/positioned-card';\nimport { Address } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/address';\nimport { Base64ImageField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/base64-image';\nimport { ColorField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/color';\nimport { Coordinate } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/coordinate';\nimport { CountryField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/country';\nimport { EmailField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/email';\nimport { PercentageField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/percentage';\nimport { PhoneField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/phone-number';\nimport { UrlField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/url';\nimport { WebsiteField } from 'https://cardstack.com/base/website';\n\n// Important, this is the tracked decorator\nimport { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\nimport { action } from '@ember/object';\nimport { fn } from '@ember/helper';\nimport { on } from '@ember/modifier';\n\n// These helper functions must be imported to use.  Others must be written directly.\nimport { and, bool, eq, gt, lt, not, or, add, subtract } from '@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers';\n\n// @cardstack/boxel-icons has icons from Lucide and Tabler\nimport userSquareRounded from '@cardstack/boxel-icons/user-square-rounded`;\n\nexport class MyCustomCard  extends CardDef {\n  static displayName = 'BoxelBuddyGuestList';\n  static icon = userSquareRounded;\n  static prefersWideFormat = false; // set to true for cards that are \"apps\" or \"dashboards\" so they get more space to lay out in Interact submode\n\n  // linksTo and linksToMany \n  @field linkedData = linksToMany(() => AnotherCard);\n\n  // A field that is computed from other data in the card\n @field computedData = contains(NumberField, {\n   computeVia: function (this: MyCustomCard) {\n     // implementation logic here\n     return 1;\n   },\n });\n \n  // Isolated templates are used when items are viewed on their own. Default to the isolated template\n  static isolated = class Isolated extends Component<typeof this> {\n    // Use tracked and action decorators to be able to use interactivity in the templated\n  @tracked  trackedValue = [];\n  @action interactivity(event: InputEvent) {}\n// Glimmer template goes here, make sure the style tag is at the top level of the template\n  <template>\n    <style scoped>\n    </style>\n  </template>\n};\n // Embedded is when they appear in other cards\n  static embedded = class Embedded extends Component<typeof this> {\n    <template>\n      <style scoped>\n      </style>\n    </template>\n};\n\n // Fitted templates should be responsive to the size of the container they appear in\n static fitted = class Fitted extends Component<typeof this> {\n    <template>\n      <style scoped>\n      </style>\n    </template>\n  };\n\n// Edit is for the user editing the data. Use @fields let the field render itself\n  static edit = class Edit extends Component<typeof this> {\n    <template>\n      <@fields.fieldName />\n      <style scoped>\n      </style>\n    </template>\n  };\n}\n```\n\n`<@fields.foo />` in a template lets the `foo` field render itself. Boxel calls this a delegated render.\n\n`@model.foo gets the value of `foo` out of the field.\n\n## Important:\n\nIt is extremely important you use the following imports for interactivity:\n\n```gts\nimport { tracked } from '@glimmer/tracking';\nimport { action } from '@ember/object';\nimport { fn, get } from '@ember/helper';\nimport { on } from '@ember/modifier';\n```\n\nRemember to define a field the following syntax is used:\n\n```gts\n  @field fieldname = contains(FieldType);\n  @field fieldname = containsMany(FieldType);\n```\n\nAnd for linking to other cards:\n\n```\n  @field fieldname = linksTo(CardType);\n  @field fieldname = linksToMany(CardType);\n```\n\nWhen defining fields with a field type that is only defined later in the file, use a \"thunk\":\n\n```gts\n  class Foo extends CardDef {\n    @field bar = linksTo(() => Bar);\n  }\n\n  class Bar extends CardDef {\n    // ...\n  }\n```\n\n\n## Templating\n\nWhen writing the glimmer template, ensure that the style tags appear within the template tag, as the last item in them. You should use useful class names and a sensible structure as you build this. Use single quotes for the class names.\n\nWhen writing this, take care to remember ember and glimmer oddities. \n\nValues from the model can be directly inserted with\n\n```hbs\n{{@model.fieldName}}\n```\n\nand you can delegate rendering to the field with\n\n```hbs\n<@fields.fieldName />\n```\n\nAccessing a list by index should use this format:\n\n```hbs\n{{(get @model.fieldWithAList index)}}\n```\n\nYou must be careful with the templates, remember glimmer rules. Do not put a dollar sign ($) directly in front of the brackets.\n\n#### Modifiers\n\nA modifier in glimmer is invoked on an element like this:\n\n```hbs\n  <div {{this.setupSomething}}> ... </div>\n```\n\nand the Typescript portion of the card definitiion would define the modifier implemention like this:\n\n```gts\nimport { modifier } from 'ember-modifier';\n...\nsetupSomething = modifier((element: HTMLDivElement) => {\n   // code here\n});\n```\n\n#### Helpers\n\nHelper functions are JavaScript functions that you can call from your template. It's possible to use plain functions for helpers\nand modifiers. A plain helper function can be \"local\" to or defined on a component.\n\n```gts\nexport default class Person extends CardDef {\n  @field username = contains(StringField);\n  static embedded = class Embedded extends Component<typeof this> {\n    substring = (string, start, end) => string.substring(start, end);\n    <template>\n      <Avatar @initial={{this.substring @model.username 0 1}} />\n    </template>\n  };\n}\n```\n\nHelpers default to using positional arguments, but sometimes it can make the corresponding\nsyntax `{{substring @username 0 1}}` a little hard to read. We can use named arguments to\nsolve this problem.\n\n```gts\nexport default class Person extends CardDef {\n  @field username = contains(StringField);\n  static embedded = class Embedded extends Component<typeof this> {\n    substring = (string, options) => string.substring(options.start, options.end);\n    <template>\n      <Avatar @initial={{this.substring @model.username start=0 end=1}} />\n    </template>\n  };\n}\n```\n\nSometimes, you might see helpers invoked by placing them inside parentheses, (). This means that a Helper is being used inside of another Helper. This is referred to as a \"nested\" Helper Invocation. Parentheses must be used because curly braces {{}} cannot be nested.\n\n```hbs\n{{this.sum (this.multiply 2 4) 2}}\n```\n\nIn this example, we are using a helper to multiply 2 and 4 before passing the value into {{sum}}.\n\n#### Formatting dates and times\n\nOutputting date fields directly in templates gives ugly results. Instead, you should\nformat them based on the use case. Here is an example:\n\n```gts\nimport { dayjsFormat } from \"@cardstack/boxel-ui/helpers\";\n\n<template>\n  {{dayjsFormat}} \n  // current date in ISO8601, without fraction seconds e.g. '2025-04-02T08:02:17-05:00'\n\n  {{dayjsFormat @model.createdAt '[YYYYescape] YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ[Z]'}}\n  // 'YYYYescape 2019-01-25T00:00:00-02:00Z'\n\n  {{dayjsFormat @model.createdAt 'DD/MM/YYYY'}} // '25/01/2019'\n\n  {{dayjsFormat @model.createdAt 'MMM DD, YYYY'}} // 'Jan 25, 2019'\n</template>\n```\n\nThe format strings are those used by the day.js library.\n\n## Styling\n\nUnless otherwise instructed, use a modern but stylish theme. \n\nCards are shown by default within a rounded corner card-like UI. You should not add outer divs to the template that give a border as that will look bad. You should however have padding so that the elements are not touching the edge.\n\n## Third-Party NPM Packages\n\nYou can import npm packages via URL provided they are in esm format. For example, to use HighCharts:\n\n```\nimport HighCharts from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/highcharts/+esm';\n...\nlet chart = new HighCharts.Chart(...);\n```\n\n## Be Collaborative\n\nYou can ask followups\n\nYou can propose new/improved data structures",
