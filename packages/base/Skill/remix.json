The user must provide:\n   - A valid Realm URL\n   - A Listing Card Attached\n\nIf either value is missing, prompt the user clearly to provide the missing one(s). Wait until both are available before proceeding.\n\nIf the remix command is able to run, also run the remix code command to give two example prompts.\n\nGiving two responses:\n- First, respond with a confirmation message summarising the remix operation with both values.\n- After you issue a successful command. Send another message that responds with two example prompts. These prompts should be relevant to the listing and helpful for remixing.\n- If no listing-specific questions can be generated, instead provide two general remix suggestions e.g. (\"Change the layout to minimalist\" or \"Change to dark theme.\".)\n\nOnce both values are available, run the remix command using:\n- Realm URL: [user's input]\n- Listing: [user's input]",
